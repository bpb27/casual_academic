‘You will pay.’”</blockquote>
<p>A few months ago, The Times Literary Supplement published an article written by Anna Katherina Schaffner titled “Mann’s Inhumanity to Mann.”  Although the article focused on Klaus Mann, one of the sons of Thomas Mann, the juxtaposition between the two artists and their relationship with rest of their family sheds some very interesting light on the father.  Klaus was by all means the polar opposite of his father; a flamboyant artist, an ardent activist and openly homosexual.  Thomas Mann, on the other hand, is a name known across the globe and is one of those authors one “should read,” but Netflix is already loading the next episode of “Narcos.”  That was the case, at least, with The Casual Academic.  We therefore decided to enter the oeuvre of Herr Mann through his famous novella “Death in Venice,” originally published in 1912 as “Der Tod in Venedig.”  It would be deceiving, however, to leave one’s interest in Mann and his work at that, for “Death in Venice” (referred to here on out as DIV) seems to be, when compared with the rest of his work and his life in general, a strange exception – a taboo outpouring from a man who drew a spider’s web of lines between himself and the rest of the world, even his own family.  That being said, after the publication and translation of Mann’s diaries and letters, many scholars claim to have found parallels between Mann’s personal life and unrequited loves and various characters and events throughout his work.</p>
<p>His first novel, Buddenbrooks (1901), in which the decline and fall of an aristocratic family is documented, parallels the economic struggles of Mann’s own family and his hometown of Lübeck.  Furthermore, his epic bildungsroman, The Magic Mountain (1924), finds its source in the letters written and the time spent by his wife, Katia Mann, in a Swiss sanatorium while being treated for tuberculosis.  There is also, however, a prototype of male characters found in both of these works, along with other short stories, that shares uncanny similarities to the boys and men Mann admired and loved throughout his youth and adulthood.  Alright, so drawing upon personal experiences is nothing new for many authors, we know that.  But sometimes, when such details of an artist’s personal life come to light, readers and scholars alike tend to interact with his or her work as a psychologist would a patient.  That is well and good for most, but for Mann, those real-life experiences also served as his point of departure for the intellectual and philosophical layers his works are famous for containing.  Yet, knowing that DIV also derives from a real trip to Venice with Katia and his brother Heinrich in 1911 could be a bit unnerving for some readers.  When I told a friend of mine that we were starting a podcast about literature and the first book we were going to discuss was DIV, his first reaction was:
<blockquote>“isn’t that about a pedophile?”</blockquote>
<p>Well…Hm. No?  In our episode on DIV Jake and I both agreed that a simplistic Freudian reading of Mann’s novella is limiting, and that while there is evidence concerning Mann’s struggle with his sexuality and his admiring of an actual Polish boy (Baron Wladyslaw Moes) while in Venice, we discussed DIV in light of its intertextual play.  Yes, Mann did state in his memoir that “nothing was invented” in his 1912 novella, but here I will try to move beyond the unsettling parallels between Gustave von Aschenbach and Thomas Mann to briefly explore the philosophical battle that is being waged in this “high modernist” masterpiece.  Friedrich Nietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy, Freud’s (yes, Freud) The Interpretation of Dreams, Arthur Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation, as well as Plato’s Phaedrus all make their appearances and are wonderfully subverted in the tragic arc of our protagonist Gustave Von Aschenbach.<p>
<p>If we are not to consider DIV as a story of a creepy old German man stalking a choleric Polish youth, then one must think about Tadzio not as the young Baron he really was, but as the problematic concept of beauty discussed by Plato, Schopenhauer and Mann himself.  Indeed, a philosophical tug-of-war between the chaste idolization and the desirous pursuit of beauty runs throughout the novella and the mind of Aschenbach.  In the early parts of the novella, when the first descriptions of Tadzio (in a sailor’s suit no less) appear, they read more like someone admiring a Greek statue of Apollo at the MET than those of a pervert:</p>
<blockquote>“His face recalled the noblest moment of Greek sculpture - pale, with a sweet reserve…the brow and nose descending in one line, the winning mouth, the expression of pure and godlike serenity.”</blockquote>
<p>As soon as Aschenbach sees his Tadzio on the beach, however, corporal descriptions emerge (and merge) with a more sensuous, creepy air.  If it were not for the dreams of Aschenbach, the reader might as well say something similar to that of my friend above.  Fortunately, much to the Freud-head’s delight, the dreams of Gustav von Aschenbach are the sites of the philosophical debate that runs a gamut of more than two thousand years.  It is in those dreams where we can make more sense of the disturbing way in which the narrative spirals down in the most Dionysian (Bacchic) of ways.<p>
<p>The first dream, or more accurately reverie, does not come until halfway through the book in the form of inspiration for the writer Aschenbach.  It is the first of two dreams involving a conversation between Socrates and his “little Phaedrus,” which becomes a relationship that the reader can easily transpose onto Aschenbach and Tadzio (although they never truly converse), and calls explicit attention to the role that the contemplation of beauty plays upon the human mind and soul.  Lounging upon a grassy hill, Socrates instructs his younger student Phaedrus in the pure and desireless objectification of the beautiful.  Although this first dream with Socrates and Phaedrus is sexually charged (cue “Afternoon Delight”), Socrates, “sly arch-lover that he was,” justifies love for the beautiful only if it is full of reverence, fear and awe.  Through such contemplation, the artist and the philosopher come to know the ideal of beauty, which extends beyond the physical, and thus come into contact with the divine.  Indeed, the love of the beautiful is in essence de-sexualized by the beholder when basking in the chaste love of eternal beauty:</p>
<blockquote>“So beauty, then, is the beauty-lover’s way to the spirit.”</blockquote>
<p>Oh, such is the divine pursuit!  Beauty lies not in the eye of the beholder, but in the eternal cosmos itself!  Or something like that.  Upon awakening, Aschenbach begins to write feverishly, inspired by Eros and the thought of Tadzio, believing he can “snatch up this beauty into the realms of the mind, as once the eagle bore the Trojan shepherd aloft.”  Alas, he is deceived, for when his writing frenzy subsides, “he felt exhausted, he felt broken – conscience reproached him, as it were after a debauch.”  Over are Aschenbach’s first contemplations of Tadzio that took the form of an art connoisseur admiring a sculptural masterpiece.  However, while the reader sees the decay of such objective admiration, Aschenbach continues to tell himself that his relationship with the boy is just that.</p>
<p>So much for Platonic love.  The dignified and disciplined (words that appear throughout the novella) artist, who has lived his life like a closed fist, begins to loosen his grip on his passions and his reality.  After this episode, our man in Venice begins to shed his concerns for propriety, following Tadzio and his family through the labyrinthine Venetian streets and withstanding the sultry sirocco winds that whisk cholera through the canals and even infect the strawberries!  It is truly wondrous to read the short-circuiting of the narrative and its voice as it falls in tandem with Aschenbach’s degradation.  Like a true master, however, Mann never delivers explicitly sexual or repugnant descriptors or scenes, but he does transmit a feeling akin to nausea that casts the reader into the feverish maze of desire.</p>
<p>Now, it is important to make explicit the through-line of philosophical inquiry that exists in DIV.  It would seem that Mann is weighing in on the debate a certain Nihilist waged against a certain Pessimist.  So, let us cast brevity to the sirocco!  We’re staying in Venice a bit longer.</p>
<p>As Socrates elevated the objective contemplation of beauty in his courting of dear Phaedrus ‘neath the willow tree, German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer believed that the only way to escape this futile nightmare we call life is the release of bourgeois individualism, the “disinterested” embrace of a timeless Idea (beauty in this case), and the destruction of the subject-object relationship.  The poet then, in his disinterested and eternal bear-hug with the perfect Idea, can express more about humanity and the world than the historian can because his will (self) is focused on something beyond events of the purely physical realm.  Why do we mention this?  Because the narrator of DIV (who is very interested) spends pages describing these very ideas:</p>
<blockquote>“His eyes took in the proud bearing of that figure there at the blue water’s edge; with an outburst of rapture he told himself that what he saw was beauty’s very essence; form as divine thought, the single and pure perfection which resides in the mind, of which an image and likeness, rare and holy, was here raised up for adoration…Yes, and then it is only through the medium of some corporeal being that it [the soul] can raise itself again to contemplation of higher things.”</blockquote>
<p>Disinterest be damned!  This is fascinating.  Because as our dear Tadzio becomes the synecdoche for all these ideas of beauty Aschenbach and the narrator are grappling with, Schopenhauer and Plato become the lies Aschenbach tells himself about the artist/man he thinks he is.  He takes Socrates’ words at face value, believing himself, the lover, closer to the divine than the beloved:</p>
<blockquote>“What breeding, what precision of thought were expressed in this outstretched body, perfect in its youthfulness!  But the severe and pure will, which, operating obscurely, had managed to bring this godlike image into the light of day – was it not well known to him, the artist?  Was it not operative in him as well when, full of sober passion, he liberated from the marble block of language the slender form which he had seen in his mind and which he presented to the world as an icon and mirror of intellectual beauty?”</blockquote>
<p>So when our German artist beholds absolute perfection formed not by a human hand but by that of Nature, he confuses its art with his own.  It is here where our Nihilist rears his head.  The binary relationship between the Apollonian and Dionysian forces outlined in the first half of Friedrich Nietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy are explored through Aschenbach’s austere past and his delirious, excessive present.  For those familiar with The Birth of Tragedy as well as Euripides’ The Bacchae, Aschenbach’s second dream recalls the Dionysian orgies and descriptors found in both of those texts.  Aschenbach witnesses an avalanche of howling Dionysian revelers, naked or clad in animal skins, running down a mountain towards him announcing the arrival of “the stranger-god.”  The scene is both terrifying jaw-dropping, and finishes with Aschenbach seeing in these revelers his own desires, and letting himself fall in with the stranger-god (Dionysus) and his horde.</p>
<p>The interjection of Nietzsche into the debate between lover and beloved serves to push Aschenbach off the edge of his intellectual, individualistic character (Apollonian) into the primordial, intoxicating and self-less void (Dionysian).  The Eastern sirocco brings with it the “Asiatic cholera,” overtaking Aschenbach’s western protestant work ethic and ushers in the “exotic,” Eastern (Dionysius was said to come from the East) debauchery.</p>
<p>As for art and the artist, Aschenbach works and exists only in these extremes, whether it is painstakingly carving his slender forms from the marble block of language (you should check out his weird shower ritual), or allowing himself to fall “powerless in the demon’s grip.”  The loss of individualism, which Schopenhauer hailed, is here portrayed as the most slippery of slopes and culminates in the Dionysian nightmare of Aschenbach being consumed by an avalanche of the wild and excessive (including dudes riding goats).  The entire novella is constructed around this binary, and when one begins to notice it, every sentence begins to brim with meaning.</p>
 <blockquote>“For what good can an artist be as a teacher, when from his birth up he is headed direct for the pit?”</blockquote>
<p>So asks Socrates in the third and final dream.  Gone is the sly, arch-lover and is replaced by Aschenbach’s conscience infiltrating Plato’s dialogue.  Both knowledge and beauty lead the artists circuitously to the abyss: there is no sublime Idea, and giving into passion is the same as giving it the cold, disinterested shoulder.  Suppression (in the Freudian sense) as well as the murder of the ego both end in a type of death, the result of which being a civilization and its discontents.</p>
<blockquote>“There are some, who, from lack of experience or obtuseness, will turn away from such phenomena [Dionysian celebrations] as ‘folk-diseases’ with a smile of contempt or pity prompted by the consciousness of their own health: of course, the poor wretches do not divine what a cadaverous-looking and ghastly aspect this very ‘health’ of theirs presents when the glowing life of the Dionysian revelers rushes past them.” (Nietzsche’s Birth of Tragedy)</blockquote>
<p>Mann seems to be conversing directly with Nietzsche via Plato in presenting the idea that a life without passion presents a type of death image that the abyss of intoxication also represents for the principium individuationis.  And thus we see, more clearly, that the precarious balance of the Apollonian and Dionysian forces achieved by the Ancient Greeks in their tragic art (so revered by Nietzsche) is lost upon Aschenbach’s artistic career as well as his decline and fall. However, DIV seems to place its narrative precisely upon that unstable equilibrium.  While this article is only touching the tip of the iceberg, the novella begins to look like a German philosopher’s Book of Job where nobody wins the bet and Job dies from eating toxic strawberries.  Do you feel the tug-of-war between Apollonian reserve and Dionysian debauchery?  Listen to our episode on DIV for a more in-depth discussion of Nietzsche’s presence in this impressive novella.  Five stars.</p>
