<blockquote>“What is an anarchist? One who, choosing, accepts the responsibility of choice.”</blockquote>
<p>-- Ursula K. Le Guin<p>
<p>Ursula K. Le Guin has been the most iconic female voice in the genre Science Fiction and Fantasy since her arrival on the literary scene writing short stories in the early 1960s. It would be cheap as well as incorrect to assume her fame has come from being one of the few female voices in a male-dominated genre. Le Guin has achieved her renown by creating fictional and fantastical realms that entertain readers and challenge many social of the norms of the mid-twentieth century. Perhaps the greatest literary universe she has created is the Hainish Cycle, which she began writing in 1966 with the book Rocannon’s World. She has continued writing in this fictional cosmos up to her compendium The Birth of the World: and Other Stories in 2002.</p>
<p>These works delve into a variety of anthropological and philosophical ideas, but the most acknowledged and lauded are her criticisms of gender and her creation of an anarchist utopia. Many who don’t know the thought and theory behind anarchism imagine the caricature of an anarchist: a mustachioed man with a menacing smile in a trench coat holding a long-wicked bomb. Those who have some background, on the other hand, may be aware of the two most prominent theorists and framers of anarchism: Peter Kropotkin and Mikhail Bakunin. Le Guin’s ideas and their implementation differ from theirs, however, as Kropotkin and Bakunin are rooted in European thought of the late-nineteenth century while Le Guin has created fictive anarchist utopias. The notion of an anarchist utopia is fully explored in Le Guin’s novel <i>The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia</i> (1974) for which she won a third Hugo Award (the award for the best sci-fi or fantasy novel). However, her first popular title within the Hainish Cycle was <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>, which, among other things, explored a society that challenged gender norms of the mid-twentieth century. Back in June of 2016, we discussed Le Guin and <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> on The Casual Academic’s eighth episode.</p>
<p>Le Guin’s literary universes are informed by her experiences as a child of two academics. She witnessed much of her parents’ work with First Nations people in North America (Primarily Canada). Growing up in a climate where celebration of analyzing art and culture fostered a deep love of mythologies, Ursula K. Le Guin’s novels often reflect the study and passion of her parents and childhood. That being said, many critics choose to cite her use of anarchist thought: Peter Kropotkin’s theory of mutual aid societies, Mikhail Bakunin’s theory of religion and state, and Emma Goldman’s criticism of patriarchy. Influences of the former two theorists can be found in The Dispossessed where she tackled what a functioning society and a utopia would look like in a community based on mutual aid. <i>In The Left Hand of Darkness</i> (<i>LHoD</i>), however, Le Guin created a criticism of patriarchy all her own. Though this work challenges notions of gender norms and sexual orientation, it is not as direct as Emma Goldman’s outright criticism of homophobia or sexism of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Furthermore, Le Guin’s embrace of Anarcho-communism, a system advocating for the dismantling of the state and private property in favor of common ownership, direct democracy, worker voluntarism (referred to as horizontal workers organizations), and collectivism can be found in <i>LHoD</i> and her other novels.</p>
<p>Assuming you haven’t had the pleasure of digging through our audio archive to listen to our summary and analysis I will provide a brief account. <i>LHoD</i>, on its surface, is a novel about a human-like protagonist named Genly Ai who is surveying the planet Gethen to see if they are suitable candidates to join an inter-planetary union. The planet is as cold and unwelcoming as its inhabitants. Shortly after Genly arrives he realizes he has landed on the planet in the midst of a Cold War of sorts (pun most definitely intended) between two of the largest national and governmental bodies on the planet. From here we see Genly attempt to observe the locals and weave his inter-galactic desires between the two factions while being caught-up in intrigue, conspiracy, and the harsh weather of the planet. However, the greater narrative in the popular and political sense comes from Genly’s relationship with a local named Estraven, as well as the customs and gender norms of the people of Gethen.</p>
<p>In <i>LHoD</i> the union or collective Genly Ai represents, the Ekumen, are hardly discussed save for a few pages at the beginning and end of the novel. But in the little space the organization occupies in the novel, their beliefs are made explicit. The Ekumen are not a body seeking power but rather coordination between members in order to ensure safety for all. Think of the Ekumen as The Republic in the Star Wars Universe.</p>
<blockquote>“The Ekumen is not a kingdom, but a co-ordinator, a clearinghouse for trade and knowledge.” (LHoD)</blockquote>
<p>The sentiments found in Genly Ai’s analysis of the Ekumen are explored by post-anarchist thinker Lewis Call. Call’s essay “Postmodern Anarchism in the Novels of Ursula K. Le Guin” analyzes the themes of modern anarchism as expressed in the utopias of Le Guin. According to Call, Le Guin’s postmodern anarchistic values question status-quo social structures and also work to redefine subjectivity. Call frames Le Guin’s use of anarchistic themes in the anarchy of the subject. That is to say, that subjectivity of the enlightenment era was rooted in rational, statist terms. Whereas Postmodern Anarchism, to which he believes Le Guin subscribes, takes on a “...perpetually provisional, deeply contextual, and powerfully psychological” subjectivity. <i>LHoD</i> embodies the latter point Lewis Call makes. The perspectives of our two main characters (Ai and Estraven) are rooted in their respective cultures (Ekumen and Gethenian) and their personal conflicts often mirror larger discrepancies between their two cultures.</p>
<p>Like anything Postmodern, one of the key manifestations of Le Guin's anarchism is not strictly found in any of the organizations or communities she invented, but rather in the composition of the book itself. While we have two main characters in <i>LHOD</i>, the narrative does not give them authority on the reader's understanding of the story or of the planet Gethen itself. Instead, the structure of the text, when considered as a whole, belies what I would like to call Le Guin's anarchist poetics. The disparate chapters that range from oral tales, scientific reports, first-person and third-person omniscient points of view, give an understanding and vision of Le Guin's world when read and thought about together, not individually.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the uncanny similarities of the myths recorded by a previous group of Ekumen scientists and the life and actions of the character Estraven. The connections Le Guin made between these chapters, as well as their subjects' destinies, points the way to a reading of this kind. Past and present inform one another, and by the end the different voices of the novel sing their songs together.</p>
<p>Le Guin, perhaps taking cues from French Post-Structuralism, destabilizes the authority of a singular discursive power into a myriad of voices. While a comparison of Le Guin to the likes of Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, and Roland Barthes is beyond the scope of this article, there is something to be said of the different voices and narrative forms that when heard together, obliges a reconsideration of the role of perspective.  As separate accounts, Genly Ai, Estraven, and other groups of scientists paint a picture of Gethenian society that is intentionally left incomplete.  Though many novels are made up of different narratives, <i>LHoD</i> puts into relief that a world can be created by putting together not only seemingly unrelated perspectives but also disparate discursive modes.</p>
 <blockquote>“The Left Hand of Darkness is Light”</blockquote>
<p>In the aforementioned weaving of past and present through disparate chapters, Le Guin leaves a shadow of binary opposition, an essence of Structuralism, that acknowledges existing political, social and artistic structures while putting into relief their limitations. As any reader brings her own cultural perspectives into reading, in the case of <i>LHoD</i> she is acculturated simultaneously alongside Genly Ai, that is to say she is being exposed to and immersed in a new culture.</p>
<p>However, her most prominent criticism is that of the binary opposition inherent in gender. At the time it was written notions of sex and gender were not studied academically nor discussed as openly as they are today. Thus a binary opposition is explored and exploded by Le Guin in <i>LHoD</i>. Whether a reader enters the novel with a fluid understanding of gender or a simple notion of man and woman, Le Guin destroys any preconceived notions.</p>
<p>In the novel Gethenian people exist in a social hierarchy that is foreign to the reader; they have fluid genders.  At the time of kemmer (the times in which they have sexual intercourse), two partners join together, exhibiting physical changes to accommodate their pairing in what could be considered pseudo-heterosexual relations. However, the Gethenians view the perennially-gendered with disgust. This is witnessed in one of Genly Ai’s early interactions with Gethenians, in which he explains that on his home planet people are always in a state of kemmer, meaning they are male or female.  The Gethenians are repulsed. In terms of the story, kemmering is much more than an excited or sexualized state for Gethenians due to the fact that it is also a fundamental element of their folklore. In the chapter “The Place Inside The Blizzard,” a folktale unfolds exposing what could be considered Gethen’s original sin: incestuous kemmering. Behind the Ekumen’s scientific reports and Gethenian folklore lies a precursor to Judith Butler’s notion of performativity.  Performativity is the idea that gender is not a stagnant social concept but something that is performed and nonverbal. Gender is a construct.</p>
<blockquote>"In this sense, gender is in no way a stable identity or locus of agency from which various acts proceede; rather it is an identity tenuously constituted in time -- an identity instituted through a stylized repetition of acts". (Performative Acts and Gender Constitution, Judith Butler)</blockquote>
<p>Context in this case is crucial to understand that <i>LHoD</i> was radical in its day for its questioning of gender norms and of the need for gender in a society. However, over the past forty-seven years, thought on gender and sexuality has advanced throughout academia. Thus, in Le Guin’s article “Is Gender Necessary?” she was initially responded defensively to critics’ focus on gender as a central theme of the novel. She had stated that the central theme was that of fidelity and betrayal. She amended the initial article in 1988 and stated that themes of fidelity and betrayal were inextricably linked to gender and sexuality in the novel. Le Guin goes on in this redux to show the deep influence of her anarchist politics on her writing, stating:</p>
<blockquote>“The ‘female principle’ has historically been anarchic; that is, anarchy has historically been identified as female.” -- Le Guin, Is Gender Necessary? (Redux)</blockquote>
<p>This is one of the many reasons why Le Guin’s work has remained under academic microscopes for nearly half a century. This novel displays the feminism of Le Guin’s anarchist politics and the anarchistic poetics of the novel. Le Guin in <i>LHoD</i> sought to show us the ways by which cultural norms dictate systemic oppression. Gender is vital to systemic oppression in the western world, in addition to other intersectional characteristics. However, Le Guin wanted to show that a world can be perilous even outside of a gendered society.</p>
<blockquote>“"On Gethen, the two polarities we perceive through our cultural conditioning as male and female are neither, and are in balance: consensus with authority, decentralizing with centralizing, flexible with rigid, circular with linear, hierarchy with network.” -- Le Guin, Is Gender Necessary? (Redux)</blockquote>
<p>As with all of her work, Le Guin has created a universe that functions as a critical lens placed upon commonly held social and political beliefs. We discussed in the podcast the fact that Gethen, especially the northern plains, operates as a “terra incognita.” These white spaces, as Alex discussed, are like the blank page that a writer faces. It is simultaneously a daunting void and rife with potential. Le Guin has taken this blank space and created a world in which her critiques of gender and social hierarchy intersect but don’t culminate in a utopian vision, but rather something imperfect and, despite their alien biology, very human.</p>
