<p>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is a very good book. So good, in fact, and so widely recognized, that it seems impossible not to know how good it is before reading it. A casual perusal of the front and back covers of my editions reveal that it won the Pulitzer Prize, the Bay Area Book Reviewers’ Award, the New York Society Library Award, and that it was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Award, and the Los Angeles Times Book Award. It was also a New York Times Bestseller. Some adjectives assigned to the book on this same cover are “towering,” “gripping,” and “gosh-wow.” I have no doubt that all of these accolades are deserved; none of these critics are wrong. The plot is both expansive and thrilling. The characters are rich and alive, full of super-human charisma and heartbreak. The prose is clean yet innovative, fun to read and devoid of missteps. The dialogue is snappy, clever, endearing. The characters and their stories are woven into capital-H History in smart ways that manage to illuminate both History and the capital-T Themes of the novel. The book literally made me laugh and cry. In other words, it is a flawlessly executed, colossal novel. It richly deserves the praise it has garnered.</p>

<p>However, the novel left some amorphous desire within me unsatisfied. Good as it was, it failed to impress itself upon me in the way the cover had seemed to promise. So in trying to write about The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, I ran up against a thornier problem than the worth of this one novel: what makes literature great? I do propose to answer that question finally, but by comparing Chabon’s novel to Anne Enright’s novel The Gathering, I hope to shed some light on what distinguishes great books from those that are merely very good.</p>

<p>I.</p>

<p>One name for what was left unsatisfied when I closed The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is the desire for transformation. Kavalier and Clay is an excellent example of the novel form, insofar as it provides all of the thrills and pleasures we expect from long-form fiction. It provoked feelings in me, but did not force me to experience new, as-yet-uncovered emotions. It told a good story, but it did not demand anything new of narrative itself. It may seem unreasonable to expect this of any novel, but a book that is at once so good and so conventional raises the question of what the ingredients of greatness are. Perhaps its conventionality is part of the reason it was so quickly celebrated and initiated into the canon.</p>

<p>Kavalier and Clay has many tightly interlocking plots, but it is most obviously about two Jewish cousins living in Brooklyn who create a series of extremely popular comic books in the 1940s. Joe Kavalier is a refugee from Prague, an illustrator, and a trained escape artist who wants to make money to get his family out of Europe. After his cousin, Sammy Clay, talks his boss into backing their idea of writing a superhero comic, they create some of the most popular comics in the world. Their biggest creation is The Escapist, a super-human escape artist who battles the forces of evil. However, their success cannot save Joe’s family from Europe, and when he hears of his brother’s death, Joe runs away from both Sammy and his lover, Rosa Luxembourg Saks, to join the navy. After Joe’s disappearance, Rosa and Sammy get married so that her child can have a plausible father and Sammy can disguise his homosexuality. The plot takes place over the course of fifteen years, providing rich portraits of the three central characters, as well as a cast of masterfully sketched secondary characters, including a Lithuanian magic teacher, a handsome gay voice actor, gluttonous capitalists, and Salvador Dali’s wife. The novel brings the 1940s to life as it skips from occupied Prague to Brooklyn to the Empire State Building to a Surrealist party in Greenwich Village to a naval base to a planned Long Island development. There is also a clever interweaving of themes of escape; Joe escapes Prague, Harry Houdini is a recurring figure (though he is already dead during the action of the novel), Sammy escapes Brooklyn, Joe escapes Rosa’s love, Sammy tries to escape his own sexuality, and it ultimately arrives at the problem of the escape from reality provided by comics. This makes the book not only a page-turner but, at times, a brain-tickler.</p>

<p>As a stylist, it is not overkill to call Chabon “flawless.” His chapter structures are innovative without being confusing. His characters leap to life in sentences. His diction is clear yet lively. Consider this description of the ornery pulp editor George Deasey, offered early in the reader’s acquaintance with him: “[H]e took no pride or true satisfaction in...any of his...achievements, because when he was nineteen, his brother Malcolm, whom he idolized, had married Oneida Shaw, the love of Deasey’s life, and taken her down to a rubber farm in Brazil, where they both died of amoebic dysentery. The bitter memory of this tragic episode, while long since corrupted by time and crumbled to an ashy grey powder in his breast, has outwardly hardened into a well-known if not exactly beloved set of mannerisms and behaviors, among them heavy drinking, prodigious work habits, an all-encompassing cynicism, and an editorial style based firmly in on ruthless adherence to deadlines and on the surprise administration, irregular and devastating as the impact of meteors from space, of the scabrous and literate tongue-lashings with which he regularly flensed his quavering staff.” In these two sentences, he sketches a whole human being. The word choice is intelligent without being showy, full of clauses that lead neatly and clearly into one another. And the book never breaks from this measured, pop-literary tone. Each chapter is elegantly crafted, beginning in the middle of a scene or action, and proceeding with such tight topic-thesis-conclusion paragraphs as to be almost academic.</p>

<p>If it is a piece of scholarship in anything other than paragraph-shape, it is a wildly imaginative monograph about the Golden Age of superhero comics. In fact the aspect of the novel that is most fully alive, even if it is not the grandest or most “literary,” is as a love-letter to comics. All three of the central characters make their livings at one time or another by creating comics, and Chabon writes about their work in a tone somewhere between scholar and fanboy. About Joe’s Luna-Moth comics, Chabon writes, “The urban dreamscapes, the dizzying perspectives, the playful tone, and the bizarre metamorphoses and juxtapositions of Little Nemo in Slumberland all quickly found their way into Joe’s pages for Luna Moth. Suddenly the standard three tiers of quadrangular panels became a prison from which he had to escape. They hampered his efforts to convey the dislocated and non-Euclidean dream spaces in which Luna Moth fought. He sliced up his panels, stretched and distorted them, cut them into wedges and strips. He experimented with bendy dots, cross-hatching, woodcut effects, even crude collage” (319). He writes with such vivid conviction about these fictitious comics that I caught myself longing to read them.</p>

<p>So the novel is doubtless a success, but I realized by the end that it succeeds in every way that we expect novels to succeed. The characters have clear Motive, are wracked by Conflict, in response to which they must Develop. This development is always intertwined with the novel’s Themes, which also connect these characters to History. The dialogue is witty, the descriptions precise, and the diction fresh. In many ways, it is a novel that leaves nothing to be desired. And yet, while it was affecting, it was not shattering. It did not wreck anything within me or within the novel form. Because other novels have had an explosive impact on me, and these are the novels I continue to value, I have tried to figure out what could be missing from a novel so obviously perfect.</p>

<p>II.</p>


<p>Compared to Chabon’s novel, Anne Enright’s The Gathering is a small, hard, brittle book. It is constructed with only the barest gesture towards plot development. Enright writes in short, frail paragraphs that lay across the page like damp twigs, and are full of melancholy insights that verge on the non-sequitur, such as: “I do not think we remember our family in any real sense. We live in them instead.” Or: “You can not libel the dead, I think, you can only console them.” In the world Enright’s reader inhabits, melancholy is not so much one feeling among others as the frame through which the world is perceived. Or consider this passage: “I am a trembling mess from hip to knee. There is a terrible heat, a looseness in my innards that makes me want to dig my fists between my thighs. It is a confusing feeling - somewhere between diarrhea and sex - this grief that is almost genital.” I found myself straining with each new paragraph to sense the particular emotional valence it was offering, until, eventually, I sank into her world.</p>

<p>In nominating any work for greatness, there is risk of excluding tastes, of being more prescriptive than descriptive, of becoming a tiresome academic who finds in their personal preferences signs of objective mastery. As I see it, the experience of greatness in literature is personal, but it is not purely subjective. Greatness is born of particular encounter between a reader and a text. Greatness is the experience of being moved or changed by literature, and cannot be alchemically produced by mere words on a page. I do not mean to suggest that Enright’s novel is absolutely, universally great, but the choice is also not arbitrary. Enright’s novel confronted me with new a new emotional tone, and seemed to strain against the confines of the English language to articulate this tone. So while it is perhaps less perfect than Kavalier and Clay, it is a better candidate for greatness.</p>

<p>The Gathering is a novel that relies less on narrative than the cumulative force of its language, so it lends itself less well to summary than Chabon’s novel. It is narrated by a woman, Veronica Hegarty, from a family of twelve siblings whose brother has recently committed suicide by drowning. The action of the novel concerns her trip to England to recover his body, their return, and his funeral, but it frequently spins off into memories, fabricated memories, reflections on the nature of memory, and reflections on and sex and marriage and parenting. I will admit that even though it is perhaps a third of the length, The Gathering took me much longer to read than Kavalier and Clay. It is a slow, abstruse, nonlinear novel that seems for a long time to withhold its purpose from the reader. I was not sucked in; reading the novel actually felt more like work than leisure. But by the time I finished it, Enright’s novel had crawled under my skin, and just thinking about it gave me chills. It articulated a quality of sadness that I had never felt, or, perhaps more accurately, had never seen in words. It struck me as a sadness all of Enright’s own, and I felt grateful for spiritual work she had done to dredge it up and write it down. Its emotional originality is achieved through obscurity, vagueness, and nonlinearity, all of which Chabon avoids in his novel. In some ways, The Gathering is supremely un-fun to read. It is cover-to-cover sad; the plot is unclear, the sentences confusing, the narrator idiosyncratic, and the characters sketched only partially. And yet, the emotional kernel of this novel is still rattling around in my chest.</p>

<p>III.</p>

<p>So I cannot give criteria of great novels, but I can list some aspects of novels that seem conducive to greatness. They tend to be difficult. They demand that the reader wrest meaning from them, rather than offering a clear story or easy message. I think this is because great novels are often trying to incubate something new, something not yet articulated, within the form of the novel. This gives the great novel a strained relationship with the formal conventions of fiction. Think of Moby-Dick, one of the best-respected novels by an American author. It is, by any conventional measure, badly constructed, with too many digressions, too many characters, poor pacing, and inconsistent prose. Yet these missteps are what allow it to push beyond the contours of perfect fiction.</p>

<p>Great novels also tend to be incomplete, meaning that they raise more questions than they answer. I am always disappointed when a complex, well-orchestrated story ends with the clean, unambiguous resolution of all of its plotlines. These stories give the reader nothing to carry with her, nothing to mull after she has closed the book. The great novels I carry in my chest have invariably shown me some new territory of the human spirit, a set of emotions or experiences that cannot be displayed through any means other than that particular novel. Because of this great novels also tend to resist summary, to be irreducible to the components that comprise them. Little is gained by describing The Gathering in words other than its own, because no other words give a sense of how or why it is important.</p>

<p>So if we want to call The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay a Great American Novel, some emphasis can fall on “American,” but the heaviest emphasis should fall on “Novel.” It demands nothing new of the novel form, constructs unique characters who nevertheless display themselves in all of the expected ways, and cleverly chosen novelistic language. Perhaps Kavalier and Clay received such universal praise because it is good and erudite while remaining fundamentally easy and fun to read. Genuine candidates for greatness tend to be at least a little un-fun. Pleasing as it was, it did not rewire my soul, did not open new internal abysses, did not break my heart along some new line. And fiction can do this. It has been doing this.</p>
