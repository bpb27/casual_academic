    <p>Perhaps due to the plethora of authors citing him as inspiration, or perhaps because of the infinite number of ways the world is currently baffling (i.e. Donald Trump), but Jorge Luis Borges recently seems to be appearing on the public radar more and more.  There have been pieces on Borges and Borgesian concepts on lithub, Electric Literature, and in the New York Times.  Online and in real life, people are trying to reconstruct the Library of Babel, a fictional library that until recently only existed in the author’s mind.  Borges’ influence is forever saturating the artistic world, but JLB’s works appear to be more common in our culture than ever before.  For those who are interested in reading Borges, however, and think the man is only labyrinths and libraries, don’t be fooled.  JLB has an infinite signification of weirdness that, even if you get Postmodernism, can still be abrasive.  Consider this: When Umberto Eco wanted to pay homage to Borges and create him as a character in his novel, The Name of the Rose, Eco chose to put him in as the “villain” of the story and portrayed him as a blind old man who hated laughter and literally devoured Aristotle’s mythical second volume of poetics, all while burning down a library and cackling hysterically.  Some type of homage.  </p>
    <p>If you insist on embarking upon the singular journey that is Borges, you will probably start with his often noted, Ficciones.  I believe that it is my duty to warn you that it is not what you think it is.  Nothing is easy with Borges and the stories are as abstract as they are bizarre.  Take a look at what is happening in just the first three stories in Ficciones. </p>
    <p>Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius.  It tells of a place, Uqbar, where people live idealistic imagined lives and he, Borges (writer/narrator), struggles to find out if the place is real or not.  A character in the story remembers Uqbar fondly due to the heretical phrase, “Mirrors and copulation are abominable, for they multiply the number of mankind.”  It is revealed that pseudo-cultists and thinkers created Uqbar and that the place was passed down amongst generations in this faction.  However, real objects from this fake place start showing up in real life.  Also, the place might actually be real and somewhere near Iraq.    </p>
    <p>The Approach to Al-Mu’tasim.  The story is actually a review of the second edition of a different story.  Of course, the second edition was not as good as the first edition and has been translated into different languages.  The second album always sucks.  The plot of the story within the story is a detective novel.  In India, a young Islamic man kills another young Hindu man and therefore becomes part of the lowest sector of society.  After several bad jobs (stealing teeth from cadavers, for example), he goes out and searches for the perfect man who can help him and give meaning to this life (Al-Mu’tasim).  Then the story ends and the reviewer talks about birds for a while.   </p>
    <p>Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote.  Now, you might be thinking to yourself, “I have heard of The Quixote, it is by Miguel de Cervantes.”  Well, I hate to break it to you, but your wrong.  See, Pierre Menard “translates” El Quixote into 17th century Spanish (if by “translate” you mean “rewrite the exact same text verbatim and then call it your own”).  Menard is so deep in his translation and research that he rewrites the Quixote—only with the same words—but his version is more correct than the original work because Menard’s Quixote has so much more meaning.  But that is not where the story ends, because Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote is actually a review of Pierre Menard’s recreation of the Quixote.  Also, Pierre Menard is not a real person.  I honestly don’t know if that makes the whole thing more or less confusing.  </p>
    <p>So, even if you are able to sift through all that information and discover the forking paths that critique totalitarianism, challenge literary criticism and discuss ideas of authenticity, Ficciones is still profoundly exigent in its weirdness.  One does not open the book and exclaim, “Borges!” and suddenly understand the vast and sprawling universe of postmodernism and its application to fiction.  Borges is hard work.  More often than not you end a story feeling profoundly confused and vaguely unsettled.   </p>
    <p>The initial struggle with Borges only leads to a bigger pay-off in the end.  Once you have read Tlon, all you want to do is find the key to unlock the meaning of the story.  Once you start looking, more and more doors open up onto different paths of meaning.  Some of the ways cross over or overlap others.  Some are just out there.  Perhaps this is why Borges named the first collections of stories, The Garden of Forking Paths.  Maybe not.  There may be no other author who is as satisfying to understand as Borges, and that is what makes him so interesting to read. </p>
    <p>I imagine that the first time you read Borges is like the character Borges, in his story, The Aleph.  The Aleph is an object in which you can witness every point in space and time at once.  The first time Borges sees the Aleph, he spends countless hours (or possibly none) staring into the object.  Once he looks away, a different  character in the story observing Borges quips, “Hell of a view, eh Borges?”  The first time you read Borges, it is like the author comes in a spectral form from the grave, taps you on the shoulder and says, “Hell of a read, eh?”  Now, picture Borges the man speaking to you while you are reading a story about Borges the character written by Borges the author about Borges the protagonist who observes one tiny space that is all spaces and times in that first space.  If you are excited to unpack the signification in lines like those, then go find a copy of Ficciones.  You are ready.</p>
