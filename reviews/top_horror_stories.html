<p>It wasn't easy choosing an adjective for the title of this article.  "Creepy" could have been any of the following: horror, terrifying, strange, surreal, macabre, hair-raising. Maybe we should have consulted a thesaurus.  Anyhow, here are our respective lists for what we think are the creepiest tales we’ve read outside of the normal canon.  If you are looking for something longer that is as creepy as it is atmospheric, go buy <i>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</i> immediately.  If you feel like you haven't read enough literary fiction on lich hunting or clockwork people, find a copy of <i>Can Such Things Be?</i> by Ambrose Bierce.  Then there’s Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper," the work of Arthur Machen, the nightmarish pessimism of Thomas Ligotti, the unspeakable terrors of H.P. Lovecraft, and the puritanical darkness of Nathaniel Hawthorne (just to name a few).  All these creepy and strange tales deserve to be on the list, but we only have 3 spots.  Enough with the preamble &#8208 here we go &#8230</p>

<p>Another Halloween is upon us, and I realize once again how much horror and weird fiction I haven't read.  I do have to thank, however, my co-host Jacob Welcker as well as some of our listeners for introducing me to the dark world of Thomas Ligotti; the tentacled gods of H.P. Lovecraft; the immanent, supernatural threat of the natural world found in Algernon Blackwood's stories; and the unsettling, "cosmic horror" that unites them all.  That being said, for my top three horror stories I've stuck to my guns I'm afraid, and while they are a bit on the unconventional side, I ask you to bear with me.</p>


<p><b>3. "The Willows," by Algernon Blackwood</b></p>

<p>Jake and I seem to agree on this one.  Blackwood is a name near and dear to the hearts of horror fans, and after having read "The Willows," to mine as well.  In it, the jolly, almost early-Melville narrative voice is the perfect vehicle for the slow psychological unraveling of the two adventurers who find something very weird and very dangerous on a trip down the Danube River.  Man versus Nature swiftly becomes Man versus an unknown, menacing universe that draws as much upon Old World folktales of the forest as New World preoccupations with the conquest of the wilderness.  If that doesn’t convince you, take H.P. Lovecraft's word for it, who said "The Willows is the finest weird story I have ever read."</p>

<p><i>"...the willows connected themselves subtly with my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow by reason of their vast numbers, and contriving in some way or other to represent to the imagination a new and mighty power, a power, moreover, not altogether friendly to us."</i><br>
And from there, all hell breaks loose.</p>

<p><b>2. "A Family Supper," by Kazuo Ishiguro</b></p>

<p>One of my favorite short stories in general, "A Family Supper" is a masterful example of ambience, unsaid truths, and how ambiguity can inspire incredible amounts of unease.  But it isn't ambiguous in the "unspeakable" and "indescribable" ways that Lovecraft and Conrad used, but rather in that as a Western reader one feels that there is a multitude of tensions and histories that pass underneath the exchanges between the three characters in the story.  A young man returns from the U.S. to his family home in Japan where he finds his younger sister has become a young, progressive woman and his father, once an esteemed businessman, is out of a job.  Ghosts not only of his mother, but of Japanese culture and history flit across the pages and the mind of the narrator, and the story, which begins with a poisonous fish, ends with the sustained doubt of whether or not the family of three has eaten it.</p>

<p><i>"There was a large pot left unopened at the centre of the table. When Kikuko had seated herself again, my father reached forward and lifted the lid. A cloud of steam rose up and curled towards the lantern. He pushed the pot a little towards me.<br>
- 'You must be hungry,' he said. One side of his face had fallen into shadow.<br>
-'Thank you.' I reached forward with my chopsticks. The steam was almost scalding. 'What is it?'<br>
-'Fish.'"</i></p>

<p><b>1. "Benito Cereno," by Herman Melville</b></p>

<p>Potentially breaking the rules, whatever they are, I've chosen Melville's 1855 novella as my favorite "creepy" story.  Coming off the commercial failure of <i>Moby Dick</i>, this novella is full of gothic allegory and terrific use of foreshadowing. It plays out as a dream, with constant questioning of what is real and the role paranoia has in the reflections of the mind. Aside from the genius structure of the story, it is also a critique on the US's continued reliance on slavery and the twilight of European imperialism in terms of its colonies and use of slave labor.  "Benito Cereno" is based on a real event, when an American merchant ship comes across a strange Spanish ship in which the crew - made up mostly of slaves - and their captain are slowly starving to death.  The truth of the situation slowly bubbles to the surface as the oblivious American captain attempts to find out what happened onboard the <i>Santo Domingo</i>.</p>

<p><i>"Upon gaining a less remote view, the ship, when made signally visible on the verge of the leaden-hued swells, with the shreds of fog here and there raggedly furring her, appeared like a whitewashed monastery after a thunder-storm, seen perched upon some dun cliff among the Pyrenees. But it was no purely fanciful resemblance which now, for a moment, almost led Captain Delano to think that nothing less than a ship-load of monks was before him. Peering over the bulwarks were what really seemed, in the hazy distance, throngs of dark cowls; while, fitfully revealed through the open port-holes, other dark moving figures were dimly descried, as of Black Friars pacing the cloisters."</i></p>

<p>Fact: I could have populated this list with only Poe stories.  After rereading "The Fall of the House of Usher," I was sure that was the creepiest thing I had ever read; frequently, what is read recently is what creates the strongest opinions in the moment.  Keeping variation in mind, I decided to axe Poe from the list.</p>

<p><b>3. "The Willows," by Algernon Blackwood</b></p>

<p>All of the stories on my list touch on a sense of dread at things beyond human control.  This can be something as nebulous as "cosmic horror" or something as natural as the weather.  The Willows is the perfect combination of the two &#8208 the surreal weather mixed with the fear it inspires creates a heightened sense of tension.  And, my god, the foreshadowing is an eleven out of ten.</p>

<p><i>"A rising river, perhaps, always suggests something of the ominous; many of the little islands I saw before me would probably have been swept away by the morning; this resistless, thundering flood of water touched the sense of awe."</i></p>

<p><b>2. "In the Court of the Dragon," by Robert Chambers (The King in Yellow)</b></p>

<p>You can't go wrong with any of the stories that feature the King in Yellow.  More widely known are "The Repairer of Reputations" and "The Yellow Sign," but I go with "In the Court of the Dragon" for just how quickly things get out of hand.  One moment the protagonist is bothered by an organist in a Parisian church, the next moment the story goes full Carcosa (The Casual Academic is going to trademark this term).  The Full Carcosa is when things get cosmically creepy &#8208 in only the best way &#8208 fast with some element of Carcosa included.  Think True Detective's final episode: one minute Rus smells aluminium and the next minute some inbred dude is throwing axes at him yelling, "Welcome to Carcosa little priest."  That is going Full Carcosa.</p>

<p><i>"And now, far away, over leagues of tossing cloud-waves, I saw the moon dripping with spray; and beyond, the towers of Carcosa rose behind the moon."</i></p>

<p><b>1. "Ylla," by Ray Bradbury (The Martian Chronicles)</b></p>

<p>A forgotten story amongst the gems of The Martian Chronicles, "Ylla" is the best story of the bunch in my estimation.  The story is woven in a way that Bradbury mastered, mixing science fiction, horror, metaphor, speculation and social commentary.  The scene in the story where the husband puts on his mask to go hunting has stuck with me for years; the slow unravelling of trust between the husband and wife while the facade of a happy marriage is maintained is devastating.  While most writers struggle to portray the dynamic between men and women in a given period of time, Bradbury does this flawlessly.  On Mars.</p>

<p><i>"The sun was gone.  Slowly, slowly the night came in to fill the room, swallowing the pillars and both of them, like a dark wine poured to the ceiling.  Only the silver lava's glow lit their faces."</i></p>
