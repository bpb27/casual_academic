  <div class="about-blocks">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Casual Academic was first conceived of as way for friends spread out across the world to occasionally drink together and cursorily discuss books over Google Hangouts.  We enjoyed hearing our own opinions so much that, a year later, we decided to begin recording them.  Now, thanks to the mysterious Brendan Brown and his great and somewhat menacing web design skills, we've developed our project a step further - filling a niche we think exists in the literature podcast world, as well as the internet in general.  There is too big of a divide between the academic and the everyday, proven all too true by recent election results and the obscene number of puppy photos circulating on social media.  Our mission is to bridge this gap with smart but comprehensible commentary and discussion on all types of literature.
    <!-- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Casual Academic began as a mere Google Hangout, giving friends across the globe an excuse to talk to each other, discuss books, and have some drinks. We enjoyed our discussions so much we decided to turn it into a podcast that we believe fills a niche in the literature podcast world - a smart, enjoyable, approachable commentary and discussion on all types of literature.  -->
